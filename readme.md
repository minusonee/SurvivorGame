# 2D Survivor-like Game

This is a simple 2D survivor-like game built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). The project is based on a [GDQuest tutorial](https://gdquest.com/), providing a foundational structure for action survival gameplay. It includes basic features such as a player character, shooting mechanics, enemy AI, and a health system.

## Features
- **Player Movement & Shooting**: Control the player and shoot projectiles to fend off enemies.
- **Enemy AI**: Enemies spawn and chase the player, attempting to deplete the playerâ€™s health.
- **Health System**: The player has a health system that decreases upon taking damage.
- **Survivor-style Gameplay**: Try to survive for as long as possible by avoiding and defeating enemies.
